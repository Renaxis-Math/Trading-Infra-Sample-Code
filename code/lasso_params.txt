eps:float, default=1e-3
Length of the path. eps=1e-3 means that alpha_min / alpha_max = 1e-3.

n_alphas:int, default=100
Number of alphas along the regularization path.

alphas:array-like, default=None
List of alphas where to compute the models. If None alphas are set automatically.

fit_intercept:bool, default=True
Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to false, no intercept will be used in calculations (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

precompute'auto', bool or array-like of shape (n_features, n_features), default=’auto’
Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up calculations. If set to 'auto' let us decide. The Gram matrix can also be passed as argument.

max_iter:int, default=1000
The maximum number of iterations.

tol:float, default=1e-4
The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than tol, the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller than tol.

copy_Xbool, default=True
If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

cv:int, cross-validation generator or iterable, default=None
Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy. Possible inputs for cv are:
    None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,
    int, to specify the number of folds.
    CV splitter,
    An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.
    For int/None inputs, KFold is used.

verbose:bool or int, default=False
Amount of verbosity.

n_jobs:int, default=None
Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.

positive:bool, default=False
If positive, restrict regression coefficients to be positive.

random_state:int, RandomState instance, default=None
The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random feature to update. ONLY Used when selection == 'random'. Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls. See Glossary.

selection: one of ['cyclic', 'random'], default='cyclic'
If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default. 
This (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.
